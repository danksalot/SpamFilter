In this assignment, you will have to implement a Rocchio text
classifier, as discussed in class. In your implementation, assume 
the following format for the input data:
   - all the training files are stored in a directory 
     called training/
   - all the test files are stored in a directory
     called test/
   - there is a file called cats.txt which includes a line for 
     each training file and for each test file, each file name
     with its corresponding category

For instance, assuming the following files:
   training/ 
       file1 file3 file4 file6
   test/
       file2 file5
The file cats.txt might include something like:
       file1 spam
       file2 no-spam
       file3 spam
       file4 spam
       file5 no-spam
       file6 spam

Test your implementation on the data set provided on the class 
webpage.
